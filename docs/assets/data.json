It intercepted and destroyed three Vanduul [Blades](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/galactapedia/article/RegdeBENkw-blade) in the Odin system in 2801, and participated in a reconnaissance mission to Vanduul space in 2819. After Muholi’s retirement in 2857, the *Flyssa* was assigned to the Stanton system under the command of Captain Chin Ormiston. The *Flyssa* was fatally damaged by the explosion of a fleeing spacecraft during an operation to remove illegal miners from Daymar. The resultant shower of debris and ore fragments shredded the thrusters, causing an overload when the Captain ordered a retreat. The *Flyssa* then careened onto the surface of the moon below. All 65 souls aboard perished. \n","template":[{}],"thumbnail":{"url":"https://cig-galactapedia-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/e0526720-abe5-4c41-a313-ee84d5dabe5d"},"categories":[{"name":"Spacecraft","slug":"spacecraft","__typename":"Category"},{"name":"Military","slug":"military","__typename":"Category"},{"name":"Human","slug":"human","__typename":"Category"}],"tags":[{"name":"uees flyssa","slug":"uees-flyssa","__typename":"Tag"},{"name":"individual spacecraft","slug":"individual-spacecraft","__typename":"Tag"}]}},{"node":{"id":"VDoPD9Ejz1","title":"X1","slug":"x1","body":"The X1 is an open-canopy snub spacecraft manufactured by [Origin Jumpworks](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/galactapedia/article/VY4WOMoj2v-origin-jumpworks) and designed by famed ship engineer Alberto Vara and his company Infinity Custom.
